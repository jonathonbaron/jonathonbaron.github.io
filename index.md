I am a PhD social science researcher who specializes in causal inference and public opinion survey research. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at Yale University in 2020.

I am currently a Quantitative Research Scientist at The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), where my work focuses on housing affordability and education. Previously, as a Research Scientist on Meta's Demography & Survey Science team, my research emphasized novel applications of experimental methods.

My academic research focuses on public opinion and political behavior, particularly in the context of nuclear policy. Much of my work focuses on [the relationship between mass attitudes toward nuclear weapons and those toward nuclear power](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gmdtb/). My research and academic CV can be accessed on this site through the links above.
