I am currently a Quantitative Research Scientist at The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at Yale University in 2020. My academic research focuses on public opinion and political behavior in the context of nuclear policy, with an emphasis on the relationship between mass attitudes toward nuclear weapons and those toward nuclear power.
