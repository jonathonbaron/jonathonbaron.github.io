I am a Research Scientist at Facebook Demography & Survey Science. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at Yale University. My academic research focuses on public opinion and political behavior in the context of nuclear policy, with an emphasis on the relationship between mass attitudes toward nuclear weapons and those toward nuclear power.
